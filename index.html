      I know today you’re carrying a lot in your heart, and you keep thinking you’re “toxic” because you overthink. But please listen to me—you are not toxic, you are human. You feel deeply, you care deeply, and sometimes your mind just runs faster than your heart. That doesn’t make you bad, it makes you real.

I see the good in you even when you can’t see it yourself. I see your kindness, your effort, and the way you worry because you don’t want to hurt anyone. A toxic person doesn’t question themselves like this—you do, because you want to be better.

On your birthday, I wish for you to be a little gentler with yourself. You don’t have to be perfect for me. You don’t have to fight your thoughts alone. I’m here, choosing you, believing in you, and standing with you—even on the days when your mind is loud.

Please smile today, even just a little. You mean more to me than you realize.
Happy Birthday, my favorite person 💫💖
